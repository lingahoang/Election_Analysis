# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has givien me the folowwing tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. 

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast. 
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes. 
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
Determine the winner of the election base on popular vote. 

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio COde, 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes. 
  - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes. 
  - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes. 
- The winner of the election was:
  - Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes. 

## Challenge Overview
I think this challenge is pretty great to start. The data was small and not very complicated. It was easy to extract data and using all the simple Python function to analyze. There was a few obstacle that I encountered which helped me learn a lot. 
- I/O operation in an enclosed file: this make me realized identation is super important. The code won't run if I missed a tab. 
- Save the code in order to run the code: if not, the code won't run correctly. 
- Always check the code: side by side run will make sure wrong code get fixed immediately. 

## Challenge Summary
With a good amount of data size, this project help me realized that we need to exact the data to the easiest way to understand. More over, this project helps me set a foundation in coding in general and  navigate more fluently through out the coding interpreter.
